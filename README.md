This is an ongoing project. I hope to maintain this website to document my projects. The intention behind this website is to be used as tool to learn more about self hosting, cyber security and web developement. I chose to run a static Hugo site so that I can host this at home on raspberry pi zero (chosen for its low power consumption).
