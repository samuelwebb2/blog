      <description>My family is passionate about cycling. Growing up my Dad would build me and my sister bikes from vintage frames and his handmade frames. Eventually, after having learned so much from my Dad about how bikes are made, I decided to build my own frame. Initially, I was going to build a touring bike but after a few months of research, I decided to build a fixed-gear bike. Living in London at the time it was convenient to have a bike that could be used for commuting and leisure.</description>
