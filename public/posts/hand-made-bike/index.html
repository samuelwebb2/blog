Growing up my Dad would build me and my sister bikes from vintage frames and his own hand made frames. Eventually after having learnt so much from my Dad about how bikes are made I decided to build my own frame.</p>
<p>Initially I was going to build a touring bike but after a few months of research I decided to build a fixed gear bike. Living in London at the time it was convenient to have a bike that could be used for commuting and for leisure. Under the derection of my Dad I planned out my entire build including the geometry of the frame and the components I would use. My school had a long unsused die-cutter machine that I used to produce the vinyl transfers featuring my simple logo inspired by the badge used by Robberts Cycles.</p>

<p>Using bikecad.ca I was able to design the frame and then print out a template to use as a guide for cutting out the tubes.</p>

<p>Thanks to the direction and skill of the teachers at Downland Cycles I was able to build the frame in a few days.</p>

<p>I then spent the next few months sourcing the components I wanted to use. I wanted to use a simple single speed drivetrain with a flip flop hub. I also wanted to use a Brooks saddle and bullhorn handlebars.</p>

<p>Having finished the bike it was time to take it for a test ride. I was very happy with the ride and the bike has been my main mode of transport ever since.</p>

<p>I entered the bike into the Bespoked bike show in Bristol. Sadly I didn&rsquo;t win any awards but I got to see so many amazing hand made bikes on display and meet their makers.</p>

<p>My fixie has proved to be a very reliable bike and I have used it for long distance rides as well as commuting. Me and my Mum rode from London to Paris in 2017 and the bike performed flawlessly.</p>

<p>Since moving to university I have retired the fixie for fear of it being stolen, I have placed the frame on my wall at home where it will likely stay for the foreseeable future.</p>
