      <description>My family are all pationate cyclists. Growing up my Dad would build me and my sister bikes from vintage frames and his own hand made frames. Eventually after having learnt so much from my Dad about how bikes are made I decided to build my own frame.
Initially I was going to build a touring bike but after a few months of research I decided to build a fixed gear bike.</description>
